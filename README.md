# app_boil

homemade boilerplate for React/Redux apps

# Description

As developers, we wanted to be able to setup a brand new app and get up & running at the speed of 
light, while keeping the high quality standards that are ours. We also wanted to give the 
opportunity to new developers to get easily up-to-speed with our way of crafting software. 
Therefore, we needed a React Boilerplate to start from, whenever we needed to build a piece of 
Front-End.

Therefore, we designed & developed with consensus an ultimate boilerplate with examples for our 
Front-End applications.

# Technologies Used:

Webpack + Babel + React + Redux + SASS + Node.js

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for 
development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live 
system.

### Prerequisites

We use Yarn to manage dependencies and run scripts.

First, you need to make sure that you have Yarn installed on your system:

```
yarn --version
```

If you don't have Yarn installed, you will need to install it. Now, there are a growing number of 
different ways to install Yarn, but we recommend that you install it through the Homebrew package 
manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed:

```
brew install yarn
```

If you use nvm or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js so that nvm's version of Node.js 
is used:

```
brew install yarn --without-node
```

### Installing

First, clone this repository on your local machine and then install the depedencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:jmz527/app_boil.git
cd app_boil/
yarn install
```

To start developing locally, run:

```
yarn start-dev
```

and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests:

```
yarn test
```
